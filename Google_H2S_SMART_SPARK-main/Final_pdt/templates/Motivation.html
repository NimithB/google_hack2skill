        <h1>Srikanth Bolla</h1>
        <h2>Early Challenges and Determination</h2>
        <p>
            Srikanth Bolla was born on July 7, 1991, in a small village in Andhra Pradesh, India. Born visually impaired
            to a family of farmers, his journey began with numerous challenges. In a society where disability often
            comes with discrimination, Srikanth faced rejection and isolation from an early age.
            <br><br>
            Despite his disability, Srikanth’s determination to pursue education never wavered. When he was denied entry
            into science programs after Class 10 due to his visual impairment, he fought a legal battle to gain the
            right to study subjects of his choice. His resilience and hard work soon bore fruit.
        </p>

        <h2>Academic Achievements</h2>
        <p>
            Srikanth excelled academically, scoring 98% in his Class 12 examinations. Despite these achievements, he
            faced skepticism from Indian universities. Unfazed, Srikanth applied to top universities abroad and was
            accepted into the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), becoming the first international
            blind student at the institution. At MIT, he specialized in business management and technology, further
            strengthening his resolve to make a difference in the world.
        </p>

        <h2>Founding Bollant Industries</h2>
        <p>
            After graduating from MIT, Srikanth returned to India to address the lack of opportunities for
            differently-abled individuals. He founded Bollant Industries, a company focused on manufacturing
            eco-friendly products such as disposable plates and cups using natural resources like areca leaves.
            <br><br>
            What sets Bollant apart is its inclusive employment policy—more than 70% of its workforce comprises
            differently-abled individuals. Under Srikanth’s leadership, the company grew into a ₹450 crore enterprise,
            proving that disability is not a limitation but an opportunity to inspire and lead.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy and Motivation</h2>
        <p>
            Srikanth Bolla’s story is one of resilience, determination, and leadership. His journey from a village boy
            to a global entrepreneur inspires countless individuals to overcome adversity and create meaningful impact.
            Srikanth’s life is a testament to the power of education, self-belief, and the desire to uplift others.

        <h1>Louis Braille</h1>
        <h2>Childhood and Early Life</h2>
        <p>Louis Braille was born on January 4, 1809, in Coupvray, France. At the age of three, an accident in his
            father's leather workshop left him blind. Despite this life-altering event, Louis exhibited remarkable
            resilience and determination.</p>

        <h2>Education and the Spark of Genius</h2>
        <p>He enrolled in the Royal Institute for Blind Youth in Paris, where he encountered "Haüy Books," featuring
            raised letters for reading. Frustrated by their inefficiency, Louis was inspired to develop a better system.
            At the age of 12, he encountered Charles Barbier's "night writing" system, which used raised dots and dashes
            for soldiers to communicate in the dark. Louis simplified and improved this method, creating a tactile
            system of six-dot cells that represented letters, numbers, and musical notes.</p>

        <h2>The Birth of the Braille System</h2>
        <p>By the time he was 15, Louis had developed the Braille system we know today. Although it faced resistance
            during his lifetime, it was officially adopted after his death. Today, Braille is a universal language of
            literacy for blind individuals, empowering millions worldwide.</p>

        <h2>Legacy and Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Louis Braille's invention is more than just a communication tool—it is a symbol of independence, dignity, and
            equality. His life reminds us that adversity can spark innovation, and even the smallest hands can change
            the world.</p>

        <h1>Helen Keller</h1>
        <h2>Overcoming the Darkness</h2>
        <p>
            Helen Keller was born on June 27, 1880, in Tuscumbia, Alabama, USA. At just 19 months old, an illness left
            her both blind and deaf, plunging her into a world of silence and darkness. For years, she lived in
            isolation, unable to communicate with the people around her.
            <br><br>
            Her parents sought help desperately, eventually connecting with Anne Sullivan, a young teacher who became
            Helen’s lifelong mentor. Anne’s innovative teaching methods helped Helen break through the barriers of her
            disabilities and opened the door to the world of language.
        </p>

        <h2>The Breakthrough with Language</h2>
        <p>
            Anne Sullivan began by teaching Helen words through finger spelling. The breakthrough came when Anne spelled
            "water" into Helen’s hand while running water over her other hand. This moment was transformative—Helen
            realized that everything had a name, and she was eager to learn more.
            <br><br>
            Helen quickly mastered the alphabet and braille, and eventually learned to speak. Her ability to communicate
            transformed her life, allowing her to connect with the world in ways that had once seemed impossible.
        </p>

        <h2>Education and Advocacy</h2>
        <p>
            Helen’s thirst for knowledge drove her to achieve what many thought was impossible. She became the first
            deafblind person to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree, graduating from Radcliffe College in 1904. Her academic
            achievements paved the way for her lifelong mission to advocate for people with disabilities.
            <br><br>
            Helen became a prolific author, writing books and essays that inspired millions. She also traveled the
            world, giving speeches and raising awareness about the rights and potential of people with disabilities.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy of Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
            Helen Keller’s life is a testament to the power of determination, education, and mentorship. Her journey
            from isolation to global recognition demonstrated that no barrier is insurmountable. She not only overcame
            her own disabilities but also became a beacon of hope for others facing similar challenges.
            <br><br>
            Helen’s legacy continues to inspire generations, reminding us that with perseverance and support, we can
            overcome even the greatest of obstacles.

        <h2>A Determined Beginning</h2>
        <p>
