        <h1>Start with Why</h1>
        <h2>How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action by Simon Sinek</h2>
        <p>
            "Start with Why" by Simon Sinek is a powerful exploration of the importance of understanding the "Why" behind 
            everything we do, both personally and professionally. Sinek argues that great leaders and organizations succeed 
            because they are driven by a clear sense of purpose. <br><br>
            He introduces the "Golden Circle" framework, emphasizing the need to start with "Why," followed by "How," and 
            then "What." This simple but profound concept reshapes the way we think about leadership and innovation. 
            <br><br>
            By highlighting examples like Martin Luther King Jr. and Apple, Sinek shows how those who inspire others 
            clearly communicate their purpose and values.
